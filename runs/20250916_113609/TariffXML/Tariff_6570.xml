Market-Based Rate Wholesale Power Tariff

1) Availability

Seller makes electric energy, capacity, and ancillary services available under this tariff to any purchaser, except as prohibited below. 

2) Rates

All sales shall be made at rates established by agreement between the purchaser and Seller. 

3) Seller Category

Seller is a Category 1 seller in all regions, as defined in 18 CFR 35.36(a).

4) Compliance with Commission Regulations 

Seller shall comply with the provisions of 18 CFR Part 35, Subpart H, as applicable, and with any conditions the Commission imposes in its orders concerning seller’s market-based rate authority, including orders in which the Commission authorizes seller to engage in affiliate sales under this tariff or otherwise restricts or limits the seller’s market-based rate authority. Failure to comply with the applicable provisions of 18 CFR Part 35, Subpart H, and with any orders of the Commission concerning seller’s market-based rate authority, will constitute a violation of this tariff. 

5) Limitations and Exemptions Regarding Market-Based Rate Authority 

Seller has received waiver of: Subparts B and C of Part 35, except for sections 35.12(a), 35.13(b), 35.15 and 35.16; Part 41, Part 101, with the exception that waiver of the provisions of Part 101 that apply to hydropower licensees is not granted with respect to licensed hydropower projects, and Part 141, except sections 141.14 and 141.15.; and received blanket approval under Part 34.  
3PR Trading, Inc., ER20-1477-000 (2020).
 
6) Mitigated Sales

Sales of energy and capacity are permissible under this tariff in all balancing authority areas where the Seller has been granted market-based rate authority. Sales of energy and capacity under this tariff are also permissible at the metered boundary between the Seller's mitigated balancing authority area and a balancing authority area where the Seller has been granted market-based rate authority provided: (i) legal title of the power sold transfers at the metered boundary of the balancing authority area where the seller has market-based rate authority; and (ii) if the Seller sells at the metered boundary of a mitigated balancing authority area at market-based rates, then neither it nor its affiliates can sell into that mitigated balancing authority area from the outside. Seller must retain, for a period of five years from the date of the sale, all data and information related to the sale that demonstrates compliance with items (i) and (ii) above.

7) Ancillary Services

Seller offers regulation service, spinning reserve service, and non-spinning reserve service to the California Independent System Operator Corporation ("CAISO") and to others that are self-supplying ancillary services to the CAISO.</record_plain_text>
