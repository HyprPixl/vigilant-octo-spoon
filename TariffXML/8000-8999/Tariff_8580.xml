1.	Availability:  1000 Mile Solar, LLC (Seller) makes electric energy and capacity available under this Tariff to any purchaser for resale.  Seller also makes available to any purchaser the ancillary services listed in this Paragraph 1: 

	RTO/ISO Specific

Southwest Power Pool: Seller offers regulation service and operating reserve service (which include 10-minute spinning reserve and 10-minute supplemental reserve) for sale to the Southwest Power Pool, Inc. (SPP) and to others that are self-supplying ancillary services to SPP.

Third Party Provider:  Third-party ancillary services: Seller offers Regulation Service, Reactive Supply and Voltage Control Service, Energy and Generator Imbalance Service, Operating Reserve-Spinning, Operating Reserve-Supplemental, and Primary Frequency Response Service.  Sales will not include the following: (1) sales to an RTO or an ISO, i.e., where that entity has no ability to self-supply ancillary services but instead depends on third parties; and (2) sales to a traditional, franchised public utility affiliated with the third-party supplier, or sales where the underlying transmission service is on the system of the public utility affiliated with the third-party supplier.  Sales of Operating Reserve-Spinning and Operating Reserve-Supplemental will not include sales to a public utility that is purchasing ancillary services to satisfy its own open access transmission tariff requirements to offer ancillary services to its own customers, except where the Commission has granted authorization. Sales of Regulation Service and Reactive Supply and Voltage Control Service will not include sales to a public utility that is purchasing ancillary services to satisfy its own open access transmission tariff requirements to offer ancillary services to its own customers, except at rates not to exceed the buying public utility transmission providers OATT rate for the same service or where the Commission has granted authorization.

2.		Applicability:  This Tariff is applicable to all sales of energy, capacity, and ancillary services by Seller, which are (a) subject to the jurisdiction of the Commission, and (b) not made pursuant to another tariff on file with the Commission.

3.		Rates:  All sales shall be made at rates established by agreement between the purchaser and Seller.

4.		Other Terms and Conditions:  All other terms and conditions shall be established by agreement between the purchaser and Seller.

5.	Compliance with Commission Regulations:  Seller shall comply with the provisions of 18 C.F.R. Part 35, Subpart H, as applicable, and with any conditions the Commission imposes in its orders concerning Sellers market-based rate authority, including orders in which the Commission authorizes Seller to engage in affiliate sales under this Tariff or otherwise restricts or limits the Sellers market-based rate authority.  Failure to comply with the applicable provisions of 18 C.F.R. Part 35, Subpart H, and with any orders of the Commission concerning Sellers market-based rate authority, will constitute a violation of this Tariff.

6.
